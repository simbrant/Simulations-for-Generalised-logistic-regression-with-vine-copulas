# Scripts for simulating data for 'Generalised logistic regression with vine copulas'

This repository contains scripts used to generate the datasets used in the simulation experiments in the paper 'Generalised logistic regression with vine copulas'. The script 'example.R' contains a simple demonstration of how to use the package LogisticCopula (available on CRAN) to fit the models to one of the datasets.
